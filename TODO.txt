Bug found in telephone mask input directive and currency input directive:
  - When you attempt to enter a value anywhere inbetween the already entered input,
    this value is pushed to the end rather than retaining its intended position.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
      I could - on every key input - go over the masked string value and filter out all non-integers.
      Then use the resulting string as the input value that should be processed into a
      masked input string value which is diplayed for the user to see.
