Bug found in telephone mask input directive and currency input directive:
  - When you attempt to enter a value anywhere inbetween the already entered input,
    this value is pushed to the end rather than retaining its intended position.
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
      I could - on every key input - go over the masked string value and filter out all non-integers.
      Then use the resulting string as the input value that should be processed into a
      masked input string value which is diplayed for the user to see.
  - When you press and hold down the backspace key, unexpected behaviours result
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
      Check StackOverflow to find out if pressing and holding down to a key
      is not triggered by the el.addEventListener('keyup', ...) listener.

Malicious user could possibly enter invalid user id in url.
Example: '/user/some-random-non-numeric-val/profile'
or any abitrary number which could be out of bound.
  POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
    Write code to enforce numeric id params and to handle out of bound errors

I normaly prefer to use a unique username or encoding the userId to a code (string)
as against using the id field in requests like this.
